but a lot of leaders tend to spend their time trying to convince people that their perspective is wrong
or doesnt accurately portray the reality or the truth of the situation
and this just angers people because the assumption is that they are wrong.
and you as the leader, are right
and thats the quickest way to trigger conflict
now as a leader in my own career and my life, ive led countless projects, teams, large departments,
and i've been wrong many times.
and if i had just taken a bit more time to listen
and to be open to different perspectives
i could have saved myself a lot of frustrations and failures.
so those three key skills, the first one is perspective taking.
i want you to try this quick exercise
close your eyes for a moment, and imagine yourself taking the point of view of one of your team members.
ask yourself as a team member, what do i want and what do i fear?
what do the answers to these questions look like?
and if you take a different perspective, such as a leader or someone in a different situation,
how would these answers differ?
and very often there is a vast difference in what different people want and that they fear
based on their status, their weatlh, their position in an organization.
perspective taking is about being able to understand a situation from the point of view of another person.
the second skill is perspective seeking
now, this skill is all about reaching out to people and trying to get a better understanding of their 
point of view on a specific topic or situation.
its about being truly and authentically curious about hearing and learning more about their perspective.
and the biggest trap of perspective seeking and something you must avoid
is reaching out to people who have the same point of view as you.
and subconsciously, validating perhaps a hard decision that you need to make.
