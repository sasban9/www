                <!-- <p>Here is a <strong>cool intro</strong> synthesizing all discussed themes:</p> -->
<p><strong>SASBAN</strong> is building at the intersection of learning, labor, games, and AI-driven opportunity. He engineers educational experiences—from screen-light HTML/JS games for children to curricula that reveal the full frontier of AI capabilities for students and fresh graduates. His work spans prompt engineering recited like scripture, 100-project coding odysseys for seasoned developers, and distribution-first playbooks for visionary careers.</p>
<p>He explores emergent million-dollar waves of technology, models the economics of abundance, and studies how ideas scale from obscurity to mass adoption. He designs journeys across India timed for weather and weekend roads, crafts future-ready syllabi, and maps how blue-collar beginnings can compound into generational wealth by retirement.</p>
<p>His playbooks draw from digital discipline, fragile memory, sudden-end preparedness, career craft, and innovators who once operated in gray zones before transforming the world.</p>
<p>He is not just documenting the future of work and education—he is <strong>prototyping it</strong> in code, courses, timelines, and real-world leverage.</p>

                <b>Welcome to the Eighth Great Gold Rush of Technology — the Generative AI Revolution.</b> Just as fortunes were made during the eras of Y2K remediation, dot-com websites, SEO arbitrage, mobile apps, cloud migration, crypto, and Web3 tools, a new wave has now begun — AI automation and low-code productization.

<p>This time, the opportunity is faster, broader, and more accessible than ever.</p>

<b>Why This Is the 8th Gold Rush</b>

<p>Every major tech shift creates a window where simple solutions built early become massive businesses later. Generative AI is today’s window — driven by three explosive trends:</p>

<b>Demand Surge:</b> Every company wants to automate manual workflows now — not next year.<br>
<b>Capability Leap:</b> New tools like ChatGPT’s built-in memory, Agents, API Actions, and File Tools let non-developers build complex solutions without code.<br>
<b>Distribution Shift:</b> Businesses are actively looking for ready-to-deploy AI automations, not proofs of concept.

<p>You don’t need to write Python or TensorFlow models. You just need to connect ChatGPT, Zapier, Make[dot]com, or Retool, and ship something businesses can use today.</p>

                <h3>The AI Leadership Mastercourse 2025</h3>
                Most AI courses in the marketplace today focus on tools, prompts, and features. They teach you how to use a chatbot. They don’t teach you how to lead an organization through a fundamental shift in how work gets done. This course is different because it isn’t built for beginners, creators, or tech hobbyists. It is built specifically for business leaders who need clarity, direction, and a competitive edge in 2025. <br><br>

Over the next two hours, you will not learn random prompts or a long list of apps. Instead, you will learn the few core ideas that determine whether a company gains velocity or gets left behind. You will understand how AI changes process design, decision-making, labor structure, cost models, customer experience, and strategic positioning. And you will leave with a 90-day execution plan that requires no technical background, no new hires, and no major investment.

GPT‑5 is a significant leap in intelligence over all our previous models, featuring state-of-the-art performance across coding, math, writing, health, visual perception, and more. It is a unified system that knows when to respond quickly and when to think longer to provide expert-level responses. GPT‑5 is available to all users, with Plus subscribers getting more usage, and Pro subscribers getting access to GPT‑5 pro, a version with extended reasoning for even more comprehensive and accurate answers.</p>
