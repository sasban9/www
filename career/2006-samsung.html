                        <h2> Digital Printing Division</h2>
                        <p>Years of research and development at Samsung have resulted in a superior technology that produces printers of
                            the highest print quality. This unsurpassed quality is evident in Samsung all-in-one ASIC, which includes
                            the hardware accelerator for half-toning called the Samsung Resolution Technology (SRT) chip. The
                            introduction of the SRT chip, which allows for finer resolution with smooth gray shading, has placed Samsung
                            as the industry leader in grayscale imaging.</p>
                        <p>Thanks to this outstanding technology, users can obtain finer, smoother, higher-resolution printed images,
                            whether they are from the Internet or from document programs. </p>
                        <p>Samsung produces Facsimile of best quality and performance. All Facsimiles are capable of handling multiple
                            applications. Samsung manufactures <span>Low end</span>, <span>Midrange</span> and <span>High end</span>
                            facsimiles specially designed to suit all the environments and budgets. The Low-end and Midrange printers
                            and facsimiles offer 12PPM to 16 PPM with most advanced emulations of PCL6, and high speed fax modems. </p>
                        <p>
                            The High-end network-ready printers offer 16PPM to 40PPM with laser printing. The Multi-function peripherals
                            (MFPs) are laser printers that include 33.6kbps baud fax modem for sending fax at lightning speed, the base
                            features such as Duplex printing/copying, color scanning (when used with PC/network) and faxing uses onboard
                            memory. All the MFPs are IEEE 1284(Parallel) standard but now they utilize the speed of USB with IEEE 1284
                            as optional. The latest MFP uses the Network interface cards, for transmission and reception of fax and
                            printer data over the network. </p>

                            networks and next generation wireless research. </p>
                        The products developed in TND encompass solutions for multiplicity of markets including service providers
                        (wireless/enterprise). TND product portfolios are based on the dynamic economics, rapid introduction of new
                        services, and rapid scalability. Most of the TND teams work with other Samsung Labs around the world in a
                        virtual team environment. <br><br>
                
                        The work areas include: <br><br>
                        (a) Product Development & Commercialization: <br>
                        The product portfolios include IP Switch, IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) and Media Gateway products, MSC Server,
                        Soft Switch, enterprise elements such as Office servers, for providing end to end solutions. This product
                        portfolio is required for rapid, large-scale deployment of wireless networks (including 3GPP & 3GPP2 networks),
                        for incumbent local exchange carriers (ILECs) and competitive local exchange carriers (CLECs), and
                        multitenant-dwelling unit (MDU) service providers. <br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                - IP Switch is designed to provide a multi services architecture and integrated, end-to-end network
                                management capabilities to provide IP backbone services in the access side of the network. Samsung IP
                                Switch enables telecommunication providers to differentiate their service offerings by delivering the
                                highest quality of service-level agreements (SLAs), quality of service (QoS), and IP Services. TND is
                                involved in development of the embedded software and applications including the fast forwarding and slow
                                forwarding operations in the data plane. A centre of excellence for the Network Processors applications
                                and IP protocols and variants is established.</li>
                            <li>- IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) represents a 3GPP and 3GPP2 effort to define an all IP based wireless
                                network as compared to the historically disparate voice, data, signalling, and control network elements.
                                IMS increases the functionality of packet-switched mobile networks by supporting IP-based applications
                                and services through the SIP protocol. However, the rapid spread of fixed-network broadband and the
                                offering of services such as transactions, content distribution, and VOIP over all-IP networks have made
                                IMS increasingly relevant to fixed operators as well. </li>
                        </ul>
                
                        Telecom Network Division is involved in the design and development of IMS network elements/functions including
                        the Application servers, session control, gateways, and traffic management algorithms. <ul>
                            <li>- Softswitch is the concept of separating the network hardware from network software. Circuit switched
                                networks rely on dedicated facilities for inter-connection and are designed primarily for voice
                                communications. The more efficient packet based networks use the Internet Protocol (IP) to efficiently
                                route voice and data over diverse routes and shared facilities. TND is involved in development of the
                                functional entities of the Softswitch and currently providing the support for worldwide deployment
                                including the development of the country specific features.</li>
                            <li>- IP Based Enterprise Systems such as office serve products including the call servers, Interactive
                                voice servers, IP phones, & next generation IP phones are being designed and developed at TND. </li>

                        <h2> Advanced Technologies Division (ATD)</h2>


                        <p>
                         Dr S Raghunandan, General Manager and Head, ATD, SISO, 29 June 2006.</p>
                         <p>In many ways, ATD is the hub of R&D in Samsung India Software Operations. With a strength of about 150 engineers today, ATD is growing at a steady pace in competence, strength, contributions, domains, value-add and importance.</p>
                         The work in ATD covers a wide spectrum from Research, Standardization, Architecture to Productization. Also, ATD
                         covers a healthy spectrum of technologies like Short-range communication protocols and platform, IP Multimedia
                         Subsystem, Ad-hoc and Mesh networks, Wireless Broadband, Multimedia (Codecs, Graphics, Streaming, QoS,
                         Applications, MM Search, etc.), Home networking, Mobile platform, DRM, Telecom (3GPP, OMA, ), etc.
                         ATD is also spearheading the initiative about Standardization efforts in SISO. Several cross-divisional
                         activities indicate good scope for synergy enhancement. With a history of incubating new technologies and
                         groups, there is a good view of trends in this division.
                         The Advanced Technologies Division has healthy co-working relationship with the Wireless Terminal Division for
                         IMS and MM Search areas, with the System LSI Division for UWB and Mesh Network areas, with Digital Printing
                         Division for Web Services area, with Telecom and Networking Division for applications on WiBro terminals. This
                         is apart from the cross-divisional Standardization activities. It is possible that soon we have relationship
                         with premier Institutions also both in India as well as abroad.
