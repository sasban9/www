            Absolutely! Here's a detailed, long-form post you can use to share what you've learned from </b>SS Squibb</b>, the entrepreneur, investor, and startup mentor known for his mission to help 10 million people start a business. -->


<h2>💡 Lessons I’ve Learned from SS: Startups, Simplicity & Service</h2>
<img src="https://www.speakeragency.co.uk/media/ms0ns4us/simon-squibb-thumbnail.jpg" align="left" height="600" alt="">
<p>SS isn’t your typical business guru. He’s raw, real, and radically focused on <b>helping people unlock their entrepreneurial potential</b>, even if they have no money, no network, and no clue where to begin. Through his content, podcast, and startup school, he shares not just tactics, but a <b>philosophy of business and life</b> that’s both accessible and deeply transformative.</p>

<p>Here are the most powerful lessons I’ve learned from SS:</p>
<h3>1. You Don’t Need Money to Start a Business</h3>

<code>"Ideas are free. So is asking."</code>

<p>One of SS’s core teachings is this: <b>the lack of money is not a real barrier</b> — the lack of <b>resourcefulness</b> is. He often talks about “making rich friends,” asking for help, bartering skills, and simply starting small.</p>

<b>What I learned:</b><br>

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>You can launch with zero cash if you offer value.</td>
<td>Ask for what you need: mentorship, help, feedback.</td>
<td>People are more generous than we think.</td>
<td>There's power in starting before you're “ready.”</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>💥 <b>Lesson:</b> Don't wait for money. Start by solving a problem. The rest will follow.</p>

<h3>2. Your Network is Your Net Worth</h3>

<code>"People are the ultimate startup capital."</code>

<p>SS emphasizes that <b>relationships are the most powerful asset</b> you can build. Instead of obsessing over funding or likes, focus on connecting with people.</p>

<b>What I learned:</b><br>

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Talk to strangers. Be open. Be human.</td>
        <td>Help others, even when there’s no immediate gain.</td>
        <td>Don’t underestimate how one relationship can change your life.</td>
        <td>Social media is your modern networking playground—use it.</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p><b>🌱 <b>Lesson:</b> Give before you ask. Invest in people and opportunities will multiply.</b></p>


<h3>3. Purpose First, Profit Second</h3>

<code>"Businesses that chase purpose last longer than those that chase profit."</code>

<p>SS often says that </b>the best businesses are born from personal pain or a mission</b> to help others. When your heart’s in the right place, people feel it—and success tends to follow.</p>

<b>What I learned:</b><br>

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Solve a problem that matters to you.</td>
        <td>Don’t just sell; serve.</td>
        <td>Build something you'd be proud to share with the world.</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>🔥 <b>Lesson:</b> Purpose isn't a luxury—it's your engine.</p>

<h3>4. Help First, Ask Later</h3>

<code>"Your ability to give is what makes you rich."</code>

<p>SS’s life mission is to help 10 million people start a business—for free. This generosity mindset has become his brand and has attracted millions of followers, fans, and collaborators.</p>

<b>What I learned:</b><br>

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Don’t guard your knowledge—share it.</td>
<td>Helping people creates trust and social capital.</td>
<td>Giving is the best long-term branding strategy.</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>🌊 <b>Lesson:</b> When you focus on contribution over competition, abundance flows.</p>

<h3>5. Rejection is Redirection</h3>

<code>"When someone says no, it’s not personal. It’s a step closer to yes."</code>

<p>SS has shared countless stories of rejection—investors walking away, businesses failing—but he reframes it all as <b>feedback and fuel</b>. His mindset is one of resilience and iteration.</p>

<b>What I learned:</b><br>

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Every no teaches you something.</td>
        <td>Rejection is part of the entrepreneurial journey.</td>
        <td>Don’t fear it — use it to refine your path.</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>🧱 <b>Lesson:</b> If you’re not getting rejected, you’re not trying hard enough.</p>

<h3>6. Just Start</h3>

<div class="container"><div class="box"><span></span><div class="content">"Imperfect action beats perfect planning."</div></div></div>


<p>SS often challenges overthinkers to <b>take the leap</b>. You don’t need a business plan, fancy logo, or a website to get going. You need action.</p>

<b>What I learned:</b><br>

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Start before you’re ready.</td>
        <td>Learn by doing.</td>
        <td>Feedback from the real world is your best teacher.</td>        
    </tr>
</table>

<p>🚀 <b>Lesson:</b> Most dreams die in the planning phase. Act now—adjust later.</p>



<h3>7. Share Your Journey Online</h3>

<div class="container"><div class="box"><span></span><div class="content"><code>"You are the brand."</code></div></div></div>

<p>SS is a master of social media storytelling. He teaches that <b>building in public</b> — sharing your progress, failures, and thoughts—is not only empowering, it’s also magnetic.</p>

<b>What I learned:</b><br>

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Document your journey, don’t fake success.</td>
<td>Be vulnerable and authentic.</td>
<td>People connect with people, not perfect brands.</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>🎥 <b>Lesson:</b> Your story has power. Share it.</p>


<h3>8. Entrepreneurship is for Everyone</h3>

<div class="container"><div class="box"><span></span><div class="content"><code>"Everyone has an idea. Most just need belief."</code></div></div></div>

<p>SS believes that <b>entrepreneurship isn’t a privilege — it’s a human right.</b> He breaks down the myth that you need to be a tech genius or an MBA to start a business.</p>

<b>What I learned:</b><br>

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Anyone with a phone and internet can launch.</td>
        <td>Your unique story and pain points can lead to a powerful business.</td>
        <td>The world needs more problem-solvers, not just polished professionals.</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>💡 <b>Lesson:</b> Business isn't elite anymore. It’s accessible to anyone who dares to begin.</p>


<h3>9. Collaboration Beats Competition</h3>

<div class="container"><div class="box"><span></span><div class="content">"The pie is big enough for all of us."</div></div></div>

<p>SS actively promotes <b>collaboration over ego</b>, encouraging creators, entrepreneurs, and even potential competitors to support each other and grow together.</p>

<b>What I learned:</b><br>

<table>
    <tr>
        <td><div class="container"><div class="box"><span></span><div class="content">Help others win, and they’ll help you win.</div></div></div></td>
        <td><div class="container"><div class="box"><span></span><div class="content">There’s enough success for everyone.</div></div></div></td>
        <td><div class="container"><div class="box"><span></span><div class="content">We rise faster when we lift each other.</div></div></div></td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>🤝 <b>Lesson:</b> Community > Isolation.</p>


<h3>10. Dream Bigger Than You Think You Deserve</h3>

<div class="container"><div class="box"><span></span><div class="content">"You are capable of more than you've ever been told."</div></div></div>

<p>SS challenges people to <b>stretch their mindset</b>—to see possibilities where they’ve been taught limitations. He reminds us that self-belief is the first and most crucial business investment.</p>

<b>What I learned:</b><br>

<table>
    <tr>
        <td><div class="container"><div class="box"><span></span><div class="content">Your dream isn’t too big—your current mindset is too small.</div></div></div></td>
        <td><div class="container"><div class="box"><span></span><div class="content">Surround yourself with people who make you think bigger.</div></div></div></td>
        <td><div class="container"><div class="box"><span></span><div class="content">Self-doubt is the enemy of your vision.</div></div></div></td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>🌠 <b>Lesson:</b> Think big. Act bold. Believe you belong.</p>


<h3>🌍 Final Thoughts</h3>

<p><img src="https://elitebusinessevent.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/simon-squibb.jpg" align="right" alt=""> SS's message is simple, but life -changing: <b>you already have what it takes to start something that matters.</b><br> You don’t need permission. <br> You don’t need perfection. <br> You just need to <b>start with purpose, give with generosity, and grow with people</b>.</p>

He embodies this truth:
