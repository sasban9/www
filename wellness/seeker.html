        question: "🍉 Your group project looks perfect on the slides, but no one’s actually rehearsed the presentation. What’s going on?",

      },
      {
        question: "🦆 Your classmate always copies homework and skips tests, but says they’re just ‘having a bad week.’",
        answer: "Apply the Duck Test. If it walks, quacks, and swims like a duck — it’s probably a duck."
      },
      {
        question: "🧊 Your friend is distant and snapping at everyone. You feel hurt. What now?",
        answer: "Use the Iceberg Principle. There’s probably a deeper issue. Gently check in with them."
      },
      {
        question: "⛏️ Your team leader seems tired and another member is absent. Ignore or act?",

      },
      {
        question: "🚩 Your friend keeps making mean jokes about you in public. They say, 'Don’t be sensitive.'",
        answer: "Red Flag! Disrespect disguised as humor is still disrespect. Trust your gut."
      },
      {
        question: "🪟 Your desk is a mess and you’re falling behind in small tasks.",
        answer: "Broken Windows Theory. One ignored mess invites more. Tidy up and reset your flow."
      },
      {
        question: "☀️ You want to post a joke online but would be embarrassed if everyone saw it.",
        answer: "Sunshine Test! If it can’t handle daylight, maybe skip the post."
      },
      {
        question: "😇 Everyone assumes the popular senior is kind and smart — no proof though.",
        answer: "Watch out for the Halo Effect. Coolness in one area doesn’t mean goodness in all."
      },
      {
        question: "🍬 You keep watching fun videos but feel bored afterwards.",
        answer: "Empty Calories for the Mind. Fun isn’t always fulfilling. Try something creative too."
      },
      {
        question: "📉 You got one bad grade and feel like everything is crashing.",
        answer: "Separate Signal from Noise. One test doesn’t define your ability. Zoom out."
      },
      {
        question: "🧱 A rule at school seems silly, and you want to ignore it.",
        answer: "Chesterton’s Fence. Understand *why* it exists before tearing it down."
      },
      {
        question: "🫢 Your group agrees silently on a bad plan to avoid conflict.",

      },
      {
        question: "👞 Your friend gives great advice to everyone but is stressed themselves.",
        answer: "Cobbler’s Children Problem. Helpers often neglect their own needs. Support them."
      },
      {
        question: "💸 You hate a course but keep at it because you’ve already spent months on it.",
        answer: "Sunk Cost Fallacy! Time spent is gone. Only continue if it’s worth it now."
      },
      {
        question: "🔦 You made a mistake in class and feel like everyone noticed.",
