# Homeschooling

### 2024-12-02

Hi! My brothers and I were all homeschooled, and I just wanted to share how well it works. We all took the US SAT in high school, and my mom kept a high school transcript. This is what most colleges want. None of us had a problem getting into college. One brother is an engineer, the other got his business degree, and I am working on my teaching degree.

 @AparnaJain1  I absolutely would! I know different states have different laws, and different colleges will have different admission policies. That does not have to hold us back. I have worked in a small Christian school, and I am currently a TA at a public elementary school. If I have children in the future, my first choice would be homeschool.

Me and my wife have been debating on this since the child was born. In India, there are some practical constraints coming our way to sort this out. We have tried for months in between and it's not too bad. But the amount of effort and energy we will need to put in, is what we are gearing up for. The child is just 3 right now, so we do have time. But please keep sharing content on this. Very few sensible Indians are there on the YouTube building content around homeschooling. So please share as much as you can around online resources, age appropriate curriculum, tools and techniques...will be super grateful..thanks

@NiTeLightYears  A high-school transcript is the official record/paper/document of grades/GPA for high school. It shows the subjects you have taken and the final score for each. In Indiana, there are specific requirements for what you have to take in high school, such as a foreign language. (I don't know if these are mandatory for homeschoolers, but my mom aligned with them). Colleges ask for the transcript and use a website called Parchment to retrieve it. Obviously as homeschoolers, my transcript was not in the system, but the colleges I applied to had an option specifically for homeschoolers to email it in.

@northshorelight35  Hi, I wrote a response sometime back, and now I see it never posted. Briefly, I am not married and don't have my own kids yet, but homeschooling made me love education. With the jobs I have had, I currently have eight years of experience in education; so I am pursuing the degree to put certification to my experience and knowledge. I may use it in public/private/Christian education, tutoring, starting my own private school, or justifying my knowledge and experience to opponents when I do finally have children of my own.

What a strange thing we do to our young people in this culture and time.  
We make them spend several years learning things that they often have no interest in, that they have not chosen and that they will in many cases never use again. We tell them that these things are vitally important. 
Then we sit them in rows and make them write about the things they can remember for an intense few hours.  We compare what they have written down with everyone else of the same age, and then we rank them. 
We make them wait a couple of months and then we tell some that they are the successes, and others that they are the failures.  We encourage them to hang their self-worth on how they performed.  Newspapers publish pictures of the delighted, whilst the disappointed hide their heads in shame. 
We tell them that these results will determine the rest of their lives – and then we set up systems that make this true.  We provide fewer opportunities for those who did not succeed. Those who did well can take their pick of courses, whilst those who did not are made to take the same tests again and again, just to hammer it home.  
We make sure that young people spend the majority of their adolescence focused on exams and under pressure. Every summer, they sit in rows and try to remember.  Each year, they're told that their whole future rests on this. 
Many of them inevitably cave in under the pressure. They become anxious and depressed. They show signs of burnout by the age of 16. They lose their spark, and just go through the motions. Some of them retreat altogether. 
Then we pathologise them, say that they need mental health treatment or to become more resilient.  We send them for therapy or give them medication. We say that they are the problem, whilst the system carries on unchanged.  
What if instead we stopped to think about what we are doing to our young people? 
Adolescence is a time of opportunity and vulnerability. It’s a one-off stage of life. What if we asked ourselves, should our young people really spend these years on a conveyor belt of high stakes exams?  
Imagine we allowed ourselves to look beyond this time and place, and to see just how strange this really is.  What would we do then?
